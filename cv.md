## About me

My name is Andrey Khlybov. I'm a self-taught Junior JavaScript developer. I was majoring Mechanical Engineering in Komsomolsk-on-Amur State Technical University in 2010 and graduated with Master degree. For a long time up now I've been interested in computer technology and 3D graphics. Also I love learning English and learn it by myself. I studied it for two years in the university when I was taking a part-time course the in Sakhalin English Training center for a year. After that I did not quit learning English and still practicing it.

Few years ago I decided to change my life and become a JavaScript developer. I have tried some courses on `Udemy` , `Codecademy` and others. Also when I have a spare time I'm practicing coding at `codewars.com`, I love algorithms and data structures.

I would describe myself as a open-minded, easy-going person with good soft skills. 

My goals are to land a job in the IT field and grow up to a Team lead or Senior position. It's pushing me to do all my best to achieve this.
